## Exercises from R4DS

Exercises from R4DS are given below. You can use the qmd-file as a starting point to make a document of solutions to the exercises. Simply insert code chunks below each question with your code to solve the given task.

### Loading the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## 1.2.5 Exercises


1.  How many rows are in `penguins`? How many columns?

2.  What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable in the `penguins` data frame describe? Read the help for `?penguins` to find out.

3.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

4.  What happens if you make a scatterplot of `species` vs. `bill_depth_mm`? What might be a better choice of geom?

5.  Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    ggplot(data = penguins) + 
      geom_point()
    ```
    
6.  What does the `na.rm` argument do in `geom_point()`? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to `TRUE`.

7.  Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for `labs()`.

8.  Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should `bill_depth_mm` be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

9.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() +
      geom_point(
        data = penguins,
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
      ) +
      geom_smooth(
        data = penguins,
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
      )
    ```
    
### 1.4.3 Exercises

1.  Make a bar plot of `species` of `penguins`, where you assign `species` to the `y` aesthetic.
    How is this plot different?

2.  How are the following two plots different?
    Which aesthetic, `color` or `fill`, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
      geom_bar(color = "red")

    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
      geom_bar(fill = "red")
    ```

3.  What does the `bins` argument in `geom_histogram()` do?


4.  Make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package.
    Experiment with different binwidths.
    What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?

## 1.5.5 Exercises

1.  The `mpg` data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains `r nrow(mpg)` observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on `r mpg |> distinct(model) |> nrow()` car models.
    Which variables in `mpg` are categorical?
    Which variables are numerical?
    (Hint: Type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

2.  Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` using the `mpg` data frame.
    Next, map a third, numerical variable to `color`, then `size`, then both `color` and `size`, then `shape`.
    How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?

3.  In the scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ`, what happens if you map a third variable to `linewidth`?
    
4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

5.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` and color the points by `species`.
    What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables?
    What about faceting by `species`?
    
6.  Why does the following yield two separate legends?
    How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    #| fig-show: hide

    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(
        x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
        color = species, shape = species
      )
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(color = "Species")
    ```


7.  Create the two following stacked bar plots.
    Which question can you answer with the first one?
    Which question can you answer with the second one?

    ```{r}
    #| fig-show: hide

    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    ```
