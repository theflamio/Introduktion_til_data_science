title: "Reshaping mpg data"

## Introduction

The aim of this exercise is to practice your data-wrangling skills using the mpg dataset.
You should be able to solve the exercise after studying the "further data wrangling" material on Moodle and occasionally you may need to confront the help file for a given function.
(You also need your previous knowledge about `ggplot` to produce the relevant graphs.)

You are asked to use the exercise qmd file (this file) as a starting point and modify it to answer all parts of the exercise.
The file should "work out of the box" in the sense that once you have downloaded the file and opened it in RStudio you can press "Knit" (Ctrl+Shift+K) and a rendered html document should pop-up.
Several R code chunks later on needs to be modified by you to work correctly and they have been disabled by setting the chunk option `eval=FALSE`.
Once you start working on the exercise you can press the "play button" (Ctrl+Shift+Enter inside the chunk) chunk by chunk as you progress.
Once a given chunk is working correctly you can delete or change the option `eval=FALSE` and press "Knit" (Ctrl+Shift+K) to see that the entire document is still rendering correctly.

We start by loading the `tidyverse` package:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Modify the code below to reshape the `mpg` data such that it has two new columns 
named `efficiency` and  `type` where the former should contain the fuel 
efficiency numbers originally given in `cty` and `hwy` and the latter indicates 
whether the driving type is city or highway (remember to enable chunk evaluation).

```{r eval=FALSE}
head(mpg)

# Reshaping the data
mpg_long <- mpg |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(cty, hwy),        # Specify the columns to pivot
    names_to = "type",          # New column for type (cty or hwy)
    values_to = "efficiency"    # New column for the efficiency values
  )

# View the reshaped data
head(mpg_long)
```

### Exercise 2

Make a plot that illustrates how fuel efficiency depends on engine size (`displ`) 
where city and highway efficiency is show with different colours in the same graph. 
The figure should include both a point layer (`geom_point()`) showing the actual 
data and a smooth line (`geom_smooth()`) showing the general tendency of the 
relationship (remember to enable chunk evaluation).

```{r eval=FALSE}
mpg_long |> 
  ggplot(aes(efficiency, displ, colour = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
