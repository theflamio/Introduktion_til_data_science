We will use the `palmerpenguins` data set. It is a data set with information on penguins. We will use the `body_mass_g` as the response variable and `species`, `island`, `sex`, `culmen_length_mm`, `culmen_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `year` as explanatory variables.

```{r}
dat <- palmerpenguins::penguins
dat <- dat[complete.cases(dat),]
head(dat)
```

We ask the following question:

1.  How well can we predict the body mass of a penguin based on species and flipper length?

2.  Are predictions improved by including other variables?

We encourage you to take as much inspiration from the lecture slides/notes as you feel like :)

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
library(broom)
```

```{r}
## YOUR CODE GOES HERE...
```

```{r}
## AND HERE...
```
